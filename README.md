# HDenseUNet_pytorch
work in progress
This is an implementation of the HDenseUNet from the paper "H-DenseUNet: Hybrid Densely Connected UNet for
Liver and Tumor Segmentation from CT Volumes"


the code is based on https://github.com/thangylvp/HDenseUet/blob/master/HDenseUnet.py which seems to be an encoder-decoder version and doesn't have the concatenation of features in the decoder leg of the UNet
